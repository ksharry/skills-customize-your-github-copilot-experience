## 📦 Deliverables (what to submit)

- A single ZIP or repository folder containing:
	- Source code files required to run your solution
	- A `README.md` with brief instructions to run your solution locally
	- Any sample input files used for testing
	- (If required) Unit tests in `tests/` or as specified

Include the following in your `README.md`:

- How to run the program (commands)
- Any assumptions you made
- How to run tests (if included)

---

## ✅ Student checklist (before submitting)

- [ ] I followed the requirements (acceptance criteria) for each task.
- [ ] My code runs without errors for the provided examples.
- [ ] I included a `README.md` with run instructions.
- [ ] (If requested) I added unit tests and they pass locally.
- [ ] I commented any non-obvious parts of my code.

## 🧾 Grading rubric (suggested)

- Correctness — fulfills requirements and example cases: 60%
- Code quality & style — readability, comments, structure: 15%
- Tests & edge cases — handles errors, includes tests: 15%
- Documentation & submission completeness — README, instructions: 10%

Feel free to replace these percentages with your class-specific rubric.

## 🛠️ Local testing & evaluation

Suggested commands students/teachers can run locally (adjust per language):

Run program (example):

```
python starter-code.py input.csv
```

Run tests (if using pytest):

```
pytest -q
```
